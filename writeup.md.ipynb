    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 5 steps.\n",
    "First,I converte the images to grayscale.\n",
    "``` javascript \n",
    "    gray = grayscale(image)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then I use gauss blur to reduce the noise point.\n",
    "At first,the kernel size Iâ€™v been used was 3,but there is still have some noise point so I set to 5,and it is better. \n",
    "``` javascript \n",
    "    kernel_size = 5\n",
    "    blur_gray = gaussian_blur(gray,kernel_size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The next step is to detect edge by canny.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    low_threshold = 50\n",
    "    high_threshold = 150\n",
    "    img_canny = canny(blur_gray,low_threshold,high_threshold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The next step is to get the region of interest that I use function as blew.\n",
    "``` javascript \n",
    "    vertices = np.array([[(imshape[1]*0.15,imshape[0]*0.95),(imshape[1]*0.45, imshape[0]*0.59), (imshape[1]*0.55, imshape[0]*0.59), (imshape[1]*0.9,imshape[0]*0.95)]], dtype=np.int32)\n",
    "    color_region = region_of_interest(img_canny,[vertices])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally I use houg_lines function to find lines,and combine two images together.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    #hough lines drawn to detect lines of a edge image\n",
    "    rho = 3\n",
    "    theta = np.pi/180\n",
    "    threshold = 15\n",
    "    min_line_length = 5\n",
    "    max_line_gap = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "    img_hough = hough_lines(color_region, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_length, max_line_gap)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #combine hough lines and initial image\n",
    "    img_weighted = weighted_img(img_hough,image)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modify the draw_lines() function by averaging the position of each of the lines and extrapolating to the top and bottom of the lane. \n",
    "Firstly,separating line segments by their slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) to decide which segments are part of the left line vs. the right line. Based on the observation,the slope of lines in left part are larger than 0.5,while the slope of lines in right part are less than -0.5.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    if abs(x1-x2) == 0:\n",
    "        slope = float(\"inf\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if slope > 0.5 and x1 > x_size/2 and x2 > x_size/2:\n",
    "        x_right.append(x1)\n",
    "        x_right.append(x2)\n",
    "        y_right.append(y1)\n",
    "        y_right.append(y2)\n",
    "    elif slope < -0.5 and x1 < x_size/2 and x2 < x_size/2:\n",
    "        x_left.append(x1)\n",
    "        x_left.append(x2)\n",
    "        y_left.append(y1)\n",
    "        y_left.append(y2)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Then fit a single line. We get slope and bias by using numpy.polyfit.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    slope, bias = np.polyfit(x_right, y_right, 1)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "The next step is to average slope and bias.\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    r_m = np.mean(x_right_all)\n",
    "    r_b = np.mean(y_right_all)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Finally,we get top x1 and bottom x2 by averaged slope and bias.(top y1 and bottom y2 are preset)\n",
    "``` javascript\n",
    "    r_x1 = (y1 - r_b) / r_m\n",
    "    r_x2 = (y2 - r_b) / r_m\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many shortcoming in the curruet pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all,it can not work well with the challenge.I think there are many noise points in the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another shortcoming could be adaptive. The test videos are special. The algorithm may fail on many other situations. For instance, weather and terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last,parameters are fixed,which may have great limitations. It takes a lot of time to improve the parameters in each situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to use color_select. In fact, in addition to white and yellow, road signs have a lot of color. It is helpfull to reduce noise points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to use a curve instead of a straight line. On a S-Bend road,straight line can not work well. lane line shoud be adaptive,no matter it's a straight line or a curve.\n"
